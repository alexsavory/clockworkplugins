Tru's Clockwork Plugins
=========

Here are all my plugins for Clockwork and its Schema's

Notes (2019)
--------------

I have updated the website files to be compatiable with newer versions of MYSQL. I have not tested these plugins in a long time. Please assume they still work. (at least since Clockwork 0.94)

Please Note:

Installation
--------------

The folders in Clockwork or a schema folder are all in plugin format, all you have to do is upload the plugins you want to your server.

##### Configure Plugins. If a plugin needs configuring, instructions will be in each plugin folder.


Exceptions 
--------------
* clockwork/clockworktoolguns - This is in the form of an ADDON. This will go in your garrysmod/addons
* clockwork/donation-coderedeemer - This has two parts, a webserver and gameserver part. Instructions included.
* clockwork/webdatabase - This has to be uploaded to a website not the game server.
* hl2rp/combinedatapad - This is in two parts, webserver and gameserver. Instructions included.
* hl2rp/webrosters - This has to uploaded to a website not a gameserver
